# Tic Tac Toe

This is the tic tac toe tech challenge given to students at makers academy in week 10 of their course. The aim is to design the backend logic of a game of tic tac toe in such a way that it would theoretically be easily integrable with a given front end design.

The entire program is written according to best practice with object oriented design and test driven development. In creating this program I paid close attention to thorough planning and detailed thinking about the logic steps of this problem. The resulting conclusions were then translated into the relevant unit and feature tests in the rspec test suite.
